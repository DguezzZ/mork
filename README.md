## What
Mork is a framework for developing approaches for NP-Hard problems using Java. 
It is currently under heavy development.

## Why
While trying to solve different NP-Hard problems using heuristic approaches, I started developing a library with common functionality to avoid excessive copy paste. Several teammates opted for the same approach, so why not put it all together and share it?
